# Honey Pot DAO

Honey Pot DAO is a decentralized lottery system built on the Solana blockchain. The game allows players to enter lotteries by purchasing a "golden ticket," with a portion of the entry fees being allocated to a community treasury. The winner of each pot receives the accumulated funds, with a percentage of each pot being added to the treasury.

### How It Works:

- **Entry Fee**: Players pay 0.05 $SOL to purchase a golden ticket.
- **Treasury Contribution**: 0.01 $SOL from each entry fee is deposited into the community treasury.
- **Staking**: Players stake their golden ticket for the duration of the pot.
- **Lottery Draw**: At the end of the pot, the wallet holding the winning ticket receives the entire pot's contents.
- **Community Treasury**: 10% of every pot is added to the community treasury.
- **Pot Variations**: There are daily, weekly, and monthly pots. Over time, additional pots with varying ticket prices, time limits, and entry rules will be introduced.
